        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        My name is Clayton Champion and I am a Junior MIS and Sports Management major at the University of Oklahoma.
        I was born and raised in Edmond, Oklahoma and attended Christian Heritage Academy. As I grew up, sports was my ultimate hobby.
        I am a basketball fanatic and have been for most of my life. In high school I played basketball for all four years of high school
        and also played football for two years. Once I graduated high school and came to OU, I joined Beta Upsilon Chi, a Christian fraternity
        through the Independent Greek Council. I have been very active in my fraternity by being involved in multiple CAC events such as University
        Sing and Scandals. My dream job is to become the head coach of an NBA Franchise and lead that team to a National Championship.
